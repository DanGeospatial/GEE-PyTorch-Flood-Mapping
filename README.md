## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to simplify deep learning workflows using Google Earth Engine to 
process satellite images and then create training tiles. The graphic above is an example of the masks (bottom images) and 
chips (top images) from Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR mosaics. Python is used to seamlessly integrate the code with PyTorch so that the 
training data is automatically downloaded onto your computer to then be read onto your GPU. A training and inference workflow
has been writen for PyTorch to demonstrate how to use these training tiles.
